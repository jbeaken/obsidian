new binary framing mechanism

-   _Stream_: A bidirectional flow of bytes within an established connection, which may carry one or more messages.
-   _Message_: A complete sequence of frames that map to a logical request or response message.
-   _Frame_: The smallest unit of communication in HTTP/2, each containing a frame header, which at a minimum identifies the stream to which the frame belongs.
- 
The relation of these terms can be summarized as follows:

-   All communication is performed over a single TCP connection that can carry any number of bidirectional streams.
-   Each stream has a unique identifier and optional priority information that is used to carry bidirectional messages.
-   Each message is a logical HTTP message, such as a request, or response, which consists of one or more frames.
-   The frame is the smallest unit of communication that carries a specific type of dataâ€”e.g., HTTP headers, message payload, and so on. Frames from different streams may be interleaved and then reassembled via the embedded stream identifier in the header of each frame.
